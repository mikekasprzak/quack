Hey Mike

LZMA2 isn't needed. LZMA2 was designed to help fragment very large LZMA files (256 MB+) across 
multiple cores (4 minimum). As a result, performance is better, but on in the quad core cases. 
If you're not multi-core compressing or decompressing, then you really don't need it.

Ta ta!
