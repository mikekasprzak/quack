
Copy "squirrel_syntax_hl.uew" to the wordfile folder.

**NOTE**: The newer versions of UltraEdit have per-user wordfiles.  


Instead of under the app folder as you used to, place them here:

C:\Users\mike\AppData\Roaming\IDMComp\UltraEdit\wordfiles

Meh.


Also, you may want to edit your JavaScript wordfile here to include JSON files.
